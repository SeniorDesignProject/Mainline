  - Software environemnt
  ----------------------
    This Demo has been developed and tested with

     - EWARM v6.50.3
     - MDK-ARM 4.60
     - TrueSTUDIO V4.0
     - TASKING VX-toolset for ARM v4.4

  - ST-LINK/V2 driver requirement
  ------------------------------
    - After installing the toolset, the ST-LINK/V2 USB driver should by installed 
      automatically. 
    - In case of trouble you may find and download the latest driver from www.st.com/mcu 
      and install it.
        
  - Hardware environemnt
  ----------------------
     - Check jumper position on the board, JP1 on, CN3 on (Discovery selected).
     - Connect the STM32L-Discovery board to a PC with a USB cable to power the board.

@par Example Description 

This demonstration firmware aims to demonstrate temperature sensor capabilities embedded in STM32L microcontroller

When powered up, the temperature sensor application example first displays a welcome 
message before immediately displaying the current temperature in degrees Celsius with a 2-
second refresh rate. When the User button is pressed once, the display shows the mean 
value from the samples acquired by the ADC. One more press of the User button toggles 
between displaying the current temperature in degrees Celsius or the averaged value 
calculated from samples acquired by the ADC.
